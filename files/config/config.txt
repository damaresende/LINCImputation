# This configuration file has the necessary parameters for running the
# LINC imputation projects. It has to start with the line 
# $configuration_file to be valid and every parameter has to have a "$"
# at the beginning of it. The input and output directories are defined
# first, than the dataset file type and names. For the dataset name
# every name must be defined with the flag $dataset_name or with
# $dataset_name ALL, which means that all valid files in the input directory
# must be considered.
#
# THIS FILE IS INCOMPLETE, IT HAS ONLY THE NECESSARY INFO FOR SOME PROJECTS, 
# ALTHOUGH IT CAN BE EXPANDED

$imp_types EC KMI MC

##Type of operations. It can be INFO for summary, AMP for amputation, 
##RMSE for RMSE evaluation and ACOR for autocorrelation evaluation
$operation INFO

##Type of the dataset. It can be CL for classification or TS for time series.
##It MUST be specified for AMP operation.
$datasets_type TS

##Missing values rate. It can be any integer between 0 and 90. 
##It MUST be specified for AMP operation.
$mv_rate 5

##List of datasets to be managed. If flag is ALL, all datasets in the specified input directory
##will be considered. If they are specifically specified by name 
##(e.g. $dataset_name istanbul_stock), only they will be considered. If they are 
##specifically specified with a '@' before the tag name, they will be disregarded.
##(e.g. $dataset_name ALL and then @$dataset_name istanbul_stock) will consider all
##datasets in the specified input directory except for istanbul_stock.
